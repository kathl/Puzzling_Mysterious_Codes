While astroquery.xmatch.XMatch works like a charm here: https://github.com/kathl/Coma_cluster-tutorial I experience 
some issues in other cases. I'll put an example notebook in this repository to show where the problem is and to test 
whether it's a problem with my computer oder whether the issues persist if I upload the thing into a Binder (it persists...)
